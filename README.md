# Welcome to Muktek Academy

We are here to ensure you have the best experience during the bootcamp, in order to help you achieve your goals and complete the program successfully we have created the next rules that are mandatory for everyone in the program .

### In order to complete the program and get your diploma you must accredited the following:

- You must have 80% attendance to classes.

- You must have 80% of the homeworks graded as satisfactory.

- Your final project must be authorized by your instructor in order to be presented at the internal and external Demo Day.

If any of the points listed above is not completed succesfully or your percentage of homework and attendance is **65% at any moment during the bootcamp**, you´ll receive as a first warning a responsive letter that states that you’ll commit to improve your grades and submit your homework immediately. If the answer to that warning is negative you will be disenrolled from the program.
