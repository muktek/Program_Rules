# Welcome to Muktek Academy

We are here to ensure you have the best experience during the bootcamp. In order to help you achieve your goals and complete the program successfully, we have created the following set of rules that are mandatory for everyone in the program .

### IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM AND GET YOUR DIPLOMA YOU MUST FULFILL THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

- You must have 90% attendance to classes (incl. Soft Skills and Speaker Events)

- You must have 80% of the homeworks graded as satisfactory.

- Your final project must be authorized by your instructor (this is also required to present at the internal and Corporate Demo Days).

If your homework completion level or attendance falls below **65% at any moment during the bootcamp**, you´ll receive as a first warning a responsive letter that states that you’ll commit to improve your grades and submit your homework immediately (you will have to sign this notice). If the answer to that warning is negative you will be advised to leave the program.

This is it. Time to get to work and collaborate with your classmates via Slack and in person.
